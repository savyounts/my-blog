<p>I'm a new web developer based in Denver, currently finishing up the Flatiron School Full Stack Web Development Program. After graduating from Clemson University in 2015, I went into the Design field and was an Art Director for a sports apparel company for a few years. A few years in, I decided I needed to change things up. I wanted a job with a certain level of creativity, but also where I would be challenged to think more logically about what I was creating.  I've loved learning code and this blog is a way for me to share about some of my struggles and accomplishments along this new journey... and also a sweet reference to remember how I got through said struggles and accomplishments without having to search the deep dark pits of the internet.  </p>
